Since I couldn't find the author's github project link, I decided to create one, with:
- some unfinished code realised
- and swagger documentation code rewritten

## What you would have on hand
- [x] Database "clean", feel free to add your favorite database managment tools
- [x]  Filtering, Sorting, Pagination integrated (only for ```Workout.js```)
- [x] Use data caching for performance improvements, with ```apicache```, ```redis```is an alternative
- [x]  API documentation with ```Swagger``` 
- [x] Integrated API access logging middleware with ```morgan```
- Some other practices might be too specified, not included.

## Refs
- ```SwaggerUI documentation``` for writting ```/v1/docs/```, quite time-consuming, I would even suggest you guys go try writting APIs with ```Python  FastAPI ``` ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“ https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md
